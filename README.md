## Minted Starter JS App

This app is an example standalone JavaScript app that uses frontend build system.


### Getting Started
1. Clone this repo down and use it as a starting point for your next JS project.
``` git clone git@github.com:andrew-minted/starter-app.git ```
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Rename the 'starter-app' directory to your project name
4. Customize your remotes
5. Customize the package.json, README.md
6. Run `gulp develop` to see the Hello World App spin up
7. Edit the 'src/components/app/app.jsx' file and press save to see your changes
live-reload in the browser window that opened from the previous step (if you left
the process running)
8. (In a new terminal) Run `gulp test` to run the linter and the unittests.
9. Run `gulp coverage` to see a nice browser-based report of all your test coverage
10. Play around with everything and customize to your heart's content :)


### Future Plans
- Automate the setup steps listed above with a generator (using slush)
